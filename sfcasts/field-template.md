# Overriding Field Templates

We know that fields describe both the *form type* that you see on the form and
also *how* that field is rendered on the detail and index pages. We also know how
easy it is to customize the form type behind this. We can `->setFormType()` to use
a completely different type or `->setFormTypeOption()` to configure one of the options

We can *also* change a lot about how each *renders* on the detail and index pages.
For example, let's play with this "Votes" field. If I autocomplete the methods on
this, we have options like `->setCssClass()`, `->addWebpackEncoreEntries()`,
`->addHtmlContentsToBody()`, and `->addHtmlContentsToHead()`. You can even call
`->setTemplatePath()` to *completely* override how this field is rendered on the
index and details page, which we'll do in a moment.

But also notice that there's `->setTemplatePath()` *and* `->setTemplateName()`. What's
going on? What's the difference?

## Template "Names" and the Template Registry

To answer that question, I'm going to hit "shift" + "shift" and open up a core class
from EasyAdmin called `TemplateRegistry.php`. If you don't see it, make sure to
"Include non-project items".

Perfect! Internally, EasyAdmin has *many* templates and it maintains this "map"
of template names to the *actual* template behind each. So when you call
`->setTemplateName()`, what you would pass is some *other* template name. For
example, I could pass `crud/field/money` if I wanted to use *that* template instead
of the normal one.

But, you probably need override the template *name* very often. Most of the time,
if you want to completely control how a field is rendered, you're going to call
`->setTemplatePath()`.

Here's the plan: when "votes" is rendered on the index and detail page, I want
to render a *completely* different template. Let's call it
`admin/field/votes.html.twig`.

Ok! Time to create that. In `templates/`, add a new directory called `admin/field`...
and a new file called `votes.html.twig`. Inside, I don't really know what to put
here yet, so I'll just put "ðŸ’¯ votes!"... and see what happens.

When we move over and refresh... there it is! We are now in *complete* control of
the votes!

## Digging into the Core Templates

But, if you're like me, you're probably wondering what we can *do* inside of here.
What variables do we have access to? One important thing to realize (and you can
see it here in `TemplateRegistry.php`) is that every single field has a corresponding
template. If you need to extend or change how a field is rendered, looking into
the *core* template is pretty handy.

For example, `votes` is an `IntegerField`. Whelp, there's a template called
`integer.html.twig`. Close this template registry and... let's go find that! On
`vendor/easycorp/easyadmin-bundle/src/`. Close up `Field/` and instead open
`Resources/views/crud/field`. And *here* is the list of *all* of the field templates
in the system. You can *also* see other templates that are used to render *other*
parts of EasyAdmin... and you can override these as well.

Open up `integer.html.twig`. You can see two things here. The first thing is three
lines of comments. This is really cool! It helps to our editor (and us) to know which
variables we have access to. Apparently, we have access to a `field` variable,
which is that very familiar `FieldDto` object we talked about earlier. All the
integer does is just... print `field.formattedValue`.

## Customizing the Template

Copy these three lines and paste them into our `votes.html.twig`. Then instead of
"ðŸ’¯ votes!", say `field.formattedValue` "votes".

And when we try this... beautiful! But I bet we can make this a little fancier!
If the votes are negative, let's put a little thumbs down. And if positive, a
thumbs up.

Take off the word "votes" here, and this, add `if field.`. Hmm. What we want to get
is the *underlying* value - the true `integer`, not necessarily the "formatted" value.
We can get that by saying `field.value`.

So `formattedValue` is the string format that would print on the page, while `value`
is the actual underlying (in this case) integer. So `if field.value >= 0`, `else`,
and `endif`. If it *is* greater than zero, add an icon with
`fas fa-thumbs-up text-success`. Copy that for our thumbs down with `text-danger`.

And... just like that, we're making this field render *however* we want. It doesn't
customize what it looks like inside of the *form* (that's entirely handled by the form
field), but it *does* control how it's rendered on the index page, *and* the details
page.

But, hmm. We also have a "votes" field inside of the Questions section. While it
would be pretty easy to also point *that* votes field to the same new template,
instead, I want to create a brand new *custom* field in EasyAdmin. That's next.
